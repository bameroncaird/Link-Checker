# Link-Checker
Python script that I wrote to check lots of links. At the time I was working as a web developer for the [Mizzou Career Center](https://career.missouri.edu/), and the script looped through every single page of [this website](https://mizzoucareertools.campuscareerinnovations.com/resources/) and checked each of the links to "resources" one-by-one. It was part of the website maintenance to check those links so I decided to automate it.

There was also an Excel file full of links that I had to modify my code for in order to check all of those links as well.
